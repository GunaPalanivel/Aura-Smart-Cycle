# Installation

It is developed using React and contains various components and dependencies. Below is a guide on how to set up and run the project after cloning it from GitHub.

## Cloning and Running a React Project from GitHub

Follow these steps to clone a Aura project from GitHub and run it locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL. For example:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
     ```
   - Run this command `https://github.com/GunaPalanivel/Aura-Smart-Cycle.git` the actual URL of the GitHub `Aura` repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
